    <h2>The Day You Sat Too Close</h2>

    <p>
        You know one thing about me?
    </p>

    <p>
        I always sit in the same place.
    </p>

    <p>
        Same corner.
        Same bench.
        Same side of the classroom.
    </p>

    <p>
        I never change my seat.
        Not for anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s my little safe space.
    </p>

    <p>
        But that day…
    </p>

    <p>
        You came and sat on the next corner.
    </p>

    <p>
        So close.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not across the room.
        Not a few benches away.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just there.
        One small distance between us.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I don’t think you will ever understand
        what that did to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        My heartbeat became so loud
        I was scared someone else could hear it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I tried to look normal.
        I tried to focus on the lecture.
        I tried to act like it was just another day.
    </p>

    <p>
        But it wasn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because you were too close.
    </p>

    <p>
        Close enough for me to notice
        the way you held your mobile.
        The way you leaned back.
        The way you slightly turned.
    </p>

    <p>
        And the more I tried to ignore you,
        the more my eyes betrayed me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I couldn’t focus.
        Not on the teacher.
        Not on the board.
        Not even on my own notebook.
    </p>

    <p>
        My mind was blank.
        My heart was racing.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I couldn’t tell anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        I couldn’t tell my friends,
        “Why is he sitting so close?”
    </p>

    <p>
        I couldn’t say,
        “I can’t breathe properly right now.”
    </p>

    <p>
        So I did the only thing I could think of.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the very first time…
        I changed my seat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Me.
        The girl who never moves.
    </p>

    <p>
        I switched seats with my friend.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because you were too close to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        And my eyes…
        my heartbeat…
        my thoughts…
    </p>

    <p>
        None of them were in my control anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was scared that if I stayed there,
        you would somehow hear everything
        my heart was screaming.
    </p>

    <p>
        And maybe you didn’t even notice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe for you,
        it was just another seat.
        Another normal day.
    </p>

    <p>
        But for me?
    </p>

    <p>
        It was the first time
        I realized
        this wasn’t just a small crush.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because if someone’s presence
        can shake your focus like that…
    </p>

    <p>
        Then it’s not something simple.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even now,
        when I think about that day,
        I can feel that same fast heartbeat.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I smile.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because you had no idea…
    </p>

    <p>
        That just by sitting beside me,
        you had already taken control
        of something I thought
        I was protecting.
