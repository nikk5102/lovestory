    <h2>The Day I Said Something Stupid</h2>

    <p>
        I still remember the exact day I found out your name.
    </p>

    <p>
        You were sitting on the next bench to ours.
        Not far.
        Just close enough for me to notice everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        My friend casually said your name.
        Just like that.
        So normal.
    </p>

    <p>
        And before I could even think…
        before I could control my mouth…
        I replied automatically —
    </p>

    <p>
        “I had a bad experience with this name.
        I stay away from people with this name.”
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t know why I said it like that.
        Maybe it was reflex.
        Maybe it was fear.
        Maybe it was me trying to protect myself
        before anything even began.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then…
    </p>

    <p>
        You just stared at me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not angry.
        Not smiling.
        Just… looking.
    </p>

    <p>
        And in that moment,
        I don’t know what you thought about me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe you thought I was rude.
        Maybe you thought I had attitude.
        Maybe you thought,
        “What kind of girl says something like that?”
    </p>

    <p>
        And honestly?
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted the ground to swallow me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because the truth was —
        I didn’t hate your name.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was scared of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was scared of feeling something again.
    </p>

    <p>
        And do you know something else?
    </p>

    <p>
        When my friend told me you were from Alwar…
        my heart paused.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because I am from Alwar too.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I never told you.
    </p>

    <p>
        I let you believe I was just from Jodhpur.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hid that tiny connection on purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because if we were from the same place,
        if we had something in common,
        it would become harder to ignore you.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I was trying so hard
        to end whatever this feeling was
        before it even started.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I built distance.
        Fake distance.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the funny thing is…
    </p>

    <p>
        Even after saying I stay away from that name,
        I never stayed away from you.
    </p>

    <p>
        My eyes still searched for you
        every time the door opened.
    </p>

    <p>
        I still noticed when you were late.
        I still noticed when you left early.
    </p>

    <p>
        And now,
        while writing this…
    </p>

    <p>
        I can still see your face from that day.
    </p>

    <p>
        The way you looked at me.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I’m smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because if I could go back,
        I would say something different.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would say —
        “I’m not scared of your name.
        I’m scared of how easily you’re becoming important.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But maybe…
        if I hadn’t said something stupid that day,
        we wouldn’t be here now.
    </p>

    <p>
        And maybe…
        you wouldn’t be reading this.
    </p>

        <button class="btn" onclick="nextPage('chapter3.html')">
            And still… I kept noticing you.
