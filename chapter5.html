    <h2>The First Time We talk</h2>

    <p>
        And then came fourth year.
    </p>

    <p>
        Guess what?
    </p>

    <p>
        We were in the same class again.
    </p>

    <p>
        Are you seeing the coincidence now?
    </p>

    <p>
        After semesters of distance,
        after fading feelings,
        after pretending it was nothing…
    </p>

    <p>
        There you were again.
        Same classroom.
        Same air.
        Same presence.
    </p>

    <p>
        But something had changed in me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wasn’t panicking anymore.
        I wasn’t switching seats.
    </p>

    <p>
        I had gotten used to it.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I saw you,
        I smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
        And when you saw me smiling,
        you smiled back.
    </p>

    <p>
        That’s it.
    </p>

    <p>
        No long conversations.
        No dramatic moments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just silent smiles.
    </p>

    <p>
        But you know what?
    </p>

    <p>
        My smile always came first.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would see you…
        and without even deciding,
        my lips would curve.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then you would notice.
        And then you would smile back.
    </p>

    <p>
        It became our tiny untalkn thing.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then one day…
    </p>

    <p>
        You came and sat beside me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like that.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not for long.
        Just for a few minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        But those few minutes?
    </p>

    <p>
        My heart remembered everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        The old days.
        The fast heartbeat.
        The seat I once changed because of you.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then you said something.
    </p>

    <p>
        So casual.
        So normal.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Mark me present.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Proxy.
    </p>

    <p>
        And guess what?
    </p>

    <p>
        I couldn’t even deny.
    </p>

    <p>
        I didn’t argue.
        I didn’t hesitate.
    </p>

    <p>
        I just said,
        “Okay”
    </p>

    <p>
        And that…
    </p>

    <p>
        That was the first time
        I ever talk to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not a confession.
        Not a deep conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just one word.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Present.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Funny, right?
    </p>

    <p>
        The first word I ever said to you
        was making sure you were marked
        as present…
    </p>

    <p>
        When you had already been present
        in my mind for years.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then,
        like you always used to do…
    </p>

    <p>
        You left the class.
    </p>

    <p>
        Calm.
        Casual.
        Like it was nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
        And just like that…
    </p>

    <p>
        Our college days ended.
    </p>

    <p>
        No big goodbye.
        No dramatic closure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just a few smiles,
        one proxy,
        and a thousand untalkn feelings.
    </p>

    <p>
        If someone had told me that day
        that one day
        you would be reading this…
    </p>

    <p>
        I would have laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because back then,
        we were just two people
        sharing a classroom.
    </p>

    <p>
        And now…
    </p>

    <p>
        You’re so much more than that.
