    <h2>When The Story Really Began</h2>

    <p>
        It had been one whole year since college ended.
    </p>

    <p>
        No contact.
        No conversations.
        Nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just memories.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then suddenly…
        you added me on Snapchat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tell me,
        how small is this world?
    </p>

    <p>
        Out of all the people,
        after all that time,
        you?
    </p>

    <p>
        And we started talking.
    </p>

    <p>
        At first it was normal.
        Casual.
        Friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
        I liked talking to you.
        Of course I did.
    </p>

    <p>
        You were my crush.
        Somewhere inside me,
        that curiosity was still alive.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I wasn’t thinking about boyfriend.
        I wasn’t thinking about anything serious.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was running away from feelings.
        From attachments.
        From risks.
    </p>

    <p>
        I just wanted to talk.
        To know you.
        That’s it.
    </p>

    <p>
        But day by day…
    </p>

    <p>
        We didn’t just talk.
        We started knowing each other.
    </p>

    <p>
        Morning to night.
        Night to morning.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whole day.
        Whole conversations.
        No breaks.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then…
        that day came.
    </p>

    <p>
        You remember, right?
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course you do.
    </p>

    <p>
        (I’m smiling while writing this.)
    </p>

    <p>
        The day you asked me
        to be your wife.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not girlfriend.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wife.
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you even realise
        what you did to my mind that night?
    </p>

    <p>
        I didn’t sleep.
        Not till 7 in the morning.
    </p>

    <p>
        I kept thinking —
        “Is he joking?”
        “Is he teasing?”
        “Is this serious?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Because you love playing with my mind.
        Teasing me.
        Confusing me.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I was stuck between
        my heart and my thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the first time in my life…
    </p>

    <p>
        I didn’t reject someone
        who had a crush on me.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I had a crush on him too.
    </p>

    <p>
        I just said,
        “I need time.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Time to process.
        Time to understand.
    </p>

    <p>
        But day by day,
        you became a habit.
    </p>

    <p>
        You became my calm.
    </p>

    <p>
        That one place where I knew —
        there is someone.
    </p>

    <p>
        My heart was sure.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Yes. He is the one.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But my mind?
        Still confused.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then…
        on propose day,
        you proposed again.
    </p>

    <p>
        And this time…
        I said yes.
    </p>

    <p>
        We didn’t even know
        how perfectly that timing aligned.
    </p>

    <p>
        Coincidence?
        Or something bigger?
    </p>

    <p>
        And then our first call.
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you remember?
    </p>

    <p>
        You were out with your friends.
        You couldn’t even tell them
        that you have someone now.
    </p>

    <p>
        You went inside the car
        just to charge your phone
        and call me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Eleven missed calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was angry.
        But the moment I saw that…
    </p>

    <p>
        My anger melted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because for the first time,
        I felt —
        this isn’t one sided.
    </p>

    <p>
        And the way you tried to calm me,
        the way you didn’t give up…
    </p>

    <p>
        It mattered.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next day —
        12-2-26.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our first video call.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was so shy before picking it.
    </p>

    <p>
        But once the call started…
        time stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
        1:40.
        And suddenly it was 7:15.
    </p>

    <p>
        We forgot the world.
        We forgot time.
        We forgot everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        Day by day,
        our conversations became deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our feelings became deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
        We understood each other.
        We saw each other.
        Not just the surface —
        but the real parts.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t know what love is supposed to feel like.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I know this —
        I am very happy with you.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I wouldn’t change a single thing about you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you know how many times
        I watched your Valentine reaction?
    </p>

    <p>
        Too many.
    </p>

    <p>
        You don’t even know
        how madly I’ve fallen for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        I blush randomly.
        I imagine us in little scenes.
        Movie moments.
        Cute things.
    </p>

    <p>
        I see couples in series.
        I see small romantic gestures.
        I see my parents’ little things.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I imagine —
        us.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to recreate all of it with you.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want a home with you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe small.
        But ours.
    </p>

    <p>
        Where every corner has our memories.
        Where happiness is simple.
        Where it’s just us
        and our love.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want to see the world with you.
        Every joy.
        Every struggle.
        Every phase.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t know what the future holds.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I know this —
        in every moment,
        I want you.
    </p>

    <p>
        You made me realise
        I deserve to be loved.
        To be someone’s priority.
    </p>

    <p>
        With you,
        I fell in love with myself again.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I don’t know how to measure
        how much I love you.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s not just “I love you.”
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s —
        I choose you.
        I see you.
        I want you in my every tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe I’ve gone a little mad in your love.
    </p>

    <p>
        But if this is madness…
    </p>

    <p>
        I never want to be normal again.
