    <h2>The Coincidence I Couldn't Escape</h2>

    <p>
        Next semester…
        you weren’t in my class anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not in my section.
        Not in my routine.
        Not in my everyday view.
    </p>

    <p>
        And slowly,
        life became normal again.
    </p>

    <p>
        No more waiting for the door to open.
        No more pretending not to look.
        No more racing heartbeat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Time did what it usually does.
    </p>

    <p>
        It faded things.
    </p>

    <p>
        I won’t lie.
        I thought maybe it was just a phase.
        Maybe it was just proximity.
        Maybe it was just imagination.
    </p>

    <p>
        And without seeing you every day,
        the intensity became softer.
    </p>

    <p>
        I told myself,
        “See? It wasn’t that deep.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And then…
        summer term happened.
    </p>

    <p>
        And somehow,
        out of all the people,
        out of all the timings,
        out of all the coincidences…
    </p>

    <p>
        There you were again.
    </p>

    <p>
        Standing there.
        Existing like you always do.
    </p>

    <p>
        And just like that,
        every single flashback hit me.
    </p>

    <p>
        The late entries.
        The quiet exits.
        The stare after I said something stupid.
        The day you sat too close.
    </p>

    <p>
        All of it came back at once.
    </p>

    <p>
        And this time,
        it didn’t feel small.
    </p>

    <p>
        It felt real.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then life added another twist.
    </p>

    <p>
        We had a mutual — Arun.
    </p>

    <p>
        I remember thinking,
        “Of course. Why wouldn’t the universe do this?”
    </p>

    <p>
        The more I tried to ignore you,
        the more you appeared.
    </p>

    <p>
        Same campus.
        Same air.
        Same unexpected encounters.
    </p>

    <p>
        I rarely saw you in classes during that time.
        It wasn’t like before.
    </p>

    <p>
        But whenever I did see you…
    </p>

    <p>
        I smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not a big smile.
        Not something obvious.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just a small one.
        The kind that happens automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I remember asking myself —
        “What is this behavior?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Why does my heart react like this?
        Why does one person keep reappearing
        every time I try to move on?
    </p>

    <p>
        Was it coincidence?
    </p>

    <p>
        Or was it something quietly pulling us
        back into each other’s orbit?
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t know.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I do know this —
    </p>

    <p>
        That summer,
        I stopped pretending it was nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because emotions don’t return that strongly
        if they were never real.
    </p>

    <p>
        And every time I saw you again,
        it felt less like accident…
        and more like something
        that was meant to happen.
