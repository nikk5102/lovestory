    <h2>The Boy Who Was Always Late</h2>

    <p>
        The first time I noticed you…  
        you weren’t even sitting in class.
    </p>

    <p>
        You entered late.
    </p>

    <p>
        The door opened softly,  
        and for a second everyone looked up —  
        including me.
    </p>

    <p>
        You walked in like it wasn’t a big deal.  
        Calm. Unbothered and smiling.. 
        Like time didn’t control you.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I don’t know why…  
        but that was the exact moment my eyes stayed on you 
        a little longer than they should have.
    </p>

    <p>
        It wasn’t love.  
        It wasn’t even a crush yet.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I don’t know why…
but something inside me shifted.
    </p>

    <p>
        You just came in…  
        sat down…  
        and existed.
    </p>

    <p>
        And somehow that felt different.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that day,  
        I started noticing a pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
        You were always a little late.
    </p>

    <p>
        And every time the door opened during lecture,  
        my heart would do something small and stupid.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Is it him?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes it was.  
        Sometimes it wasn’t.
    </p>

    <p>
        But on the days it was…
    </p>

    <p>
        I would pretend to look at my notebook  
        while secretly watching you walk to your seat.
    </p>
 <p>
        And then I started thinking something else.
    </p>

    <p>
        I thought you must be very loyal to someone.
    </p>

    <p>
        I used to imagine that maybe there was a girl waiting for you somewhere…  
        someone you were completely committed to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because the way you never looked at any girl —  
        not even once properly —  
        shocked me.
    </p>

    <p>
        You never tried to impress anyone.  
        Never flirted.  
        Never even let your eyes wander.
    </p>
     <p>
        And I used to sit there wondering…  
        what kind of person is he?
    </p>

    <p>
        Does he not find anyone interesting?  
        Or is he already someone’s?
    </p>

    <p>
        I convinced myself that maybe you couldn’t even stay a second without her.
    </p> 
     <p>
        That maybe the moment class gave you freedom…  
        you were rushing to go see her.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whenever you got the smallest chance —  
        attendance done, lecture boring, teacher distracted —
    </p>

    <p>
        you would quietly leave.
    </p> 
   

    <p>
        Just gone.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I don’t think you’ll ever understand this…
    </p>

    <p>
        But every time you stood up to leave,  
        my eyes followed you till the door closed.
    </p>

    <p>
        And when it did?
    </p>

    <p>
        The class suddenly felt…  
        a little emptier.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s funny, isn’t it?
    </p>

    <p>
        We never talk.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not even once properly.
    </p>

    <p>
        But my day somehow depended  
        on whether you showed up late  
        or disappeared early.
    </p>

    <p>
        You never knew.
    </p>

    <p>
        You never knew that someone sitting a few benches away  
        had memorized your timing.
    </p>

    <p>
        That someone’s eyes searched for the door  
        every single lecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        That someone noticed  
        when you weren’t there.
    </p>

    <p>
        And maybe it was silly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe it was just a quiet girl  
        finding something beautiful  
        in the most ordinary boy.
    </p>

    <p>
        But for me…
    </p>

    <p>
        You weren’t just the boy who came late.
    </p>

    <p>
        You were the reason  
        I started looking at the door  
        more than the board.
